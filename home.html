  <h1>Understanding Disinformation</h1>

  <p><strong>An exploration of disinformation through a Russian troll farm</strong></p>
  <p>This project is an investigation into “troll” farms and how technology is utilized to sow discord among the American public through social media. The data used in this investigation is primarily from Facebook as presented to the Intelligence House Committee by Facebook during the November 2017 open hearings on social media companies ("Exposing Russia’s Effort to Sow Discord Online," n.d.). The particular data used in this project has been extracted and compiled by the Department of Communication at the University of Maryland ("Internet Research Agency Ads," n.d.).</p>

<h2>What is a Troll?</h2>

<p>In order to understand disinformation and its intentional dissemination, it is important to understand trolling as it exists on the internet. An internet troll is traditionally someone who delights from sowing discord on the internet (Campbell, 2006). By provoking unsuspecting victims, trolls incite confusion, distress, and misinformation. If victims respond or retaliate, they in effect contribute to the stream of misinformation by providing a cause for response by the troll.

Trolls have existed on the internet since well before the term came into modern usage. The Wired article “The War Between alt.tasteless and rec.pets.cats” (Quittner, 1994) outlines a typical troll scenario in the early 1990s between two Usenet groups without using the term troll. alt.tasteless “trolled” rec.pets.cats through a coordinated “stealth attack,” effectively flooding their communication channels with nonsensical to dangerous posts. An active member of rec.pets.cats was threatened by members of alt.tasteless when she took proactive measures to quell the attack, receiving death threats for her actions, pointing to how trolling even in the early 1990s manifested themselves in the physical.

As the internet aged, trolling became more refined and more mainstream. The anonymity provided by forums such as 4chan gave a space for users to troll without much consequence, and more importantly with a support community (Feinberg, 2014). While trolls were a nuisance, their impact largely was largely contained to cyberspace and their mission generally arbitrary (however with hints of sexism, racism, and reactionary). In the 2010s, a renewed interest in trolls arose. High profile controversies such as Gamergate and Sud Puppies began impacting communities and their autonomies. Around this time, trolls were increasingly coordinating to impact various communities in pointed ways, such as the gamer community or science fiction community.</p>
